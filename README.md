This repository is about Cross and Noughts game in Java programming language. This application has the ability to store and display two users' names since it can played 
by maximum of two players. It has the capability to examine rows, columns and diagonals.

**What I learnt while making this application above:** The two players of the game can write their names in the game so that the game can tell whose turn is it. In this 
case, I have learnt how to make a scanner ask the players for theirs names, creating a 3*3 array that represent our tic tac board. There are many comments on the code 
which demonstrates the viewer how each aspect of code functions in the programme. This also shows my understanding of how the programme works. 

**How might I improve:** Adding features that can help users to track or remove previous actions in their turns.
